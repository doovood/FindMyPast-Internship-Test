# FindMyPast-Internship-Test
JavaScript test for the Find My Past internship opertunity. The test was to create a multiplication grid based on prime numbers.

## Getting Started
The test has been developed using javascript in a web based manner. A simple HTML interface has been created using the Bootstrap framwork.

1.  To use the program open the [Index.html](../blob/master/index.html) file from the repository. 
2.  Once opened simply enter the number of the primes that you wish to generate.
3.  Finally Click the button labled "Calculate".

## Algorithm
To generate the prime numbers a Trial Division algorithm has been used. The Algorithm chosen test the number all the numbers from from two to the square root of the number being tested. In large test this signicantly reduced the number of tests.

## What im pleased with?
Out of everything from this test the thing I am most pleased with is that I stuck at it until I understood the math behind these algorithms as the math is my biggest weakness but one I enjoy challenging until I learn something new, if nothing else I have gained a better understanding of making a program such as this.

Overall, I am pleased that the program gives the expected output.

## What would I do if I had more time?
If I had more time now that I have a better understanding of these algorithms I would definety change my algorithm from a trial division to an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm which would significantly improve the efficiancy of the program if I can figure out how to find the nth with out a trial division.
I would most probably have a counter running to keep count of the nth increasing the upperbound of the algorthm until the required number of primes is found.
